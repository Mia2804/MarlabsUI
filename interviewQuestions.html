    2. 5 block-level and inline Elements<br>
    --Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
    <div>The following span is an <span class="highlight">inline element</span>;
        its background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of
        the inline element's influence.</div>
    <div>The following paragraph is a <p class="highlight">block-level element;</p>
            its background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of
            the block-level element's influence.</div>
            The p element totally changes the layout of the text, splitting it into three segments: the text before the p, then the p's text, and finally the text following the p.

            <Strong>Changing element levels</Strong>
        You can change the visual presentation of an element using the CSS display property. For example, by changing the value of display from "inline" to "block", you can tell the browser to render the inline element in a block box rather than an inline box, and vice versa. However, doing this will not change the category and the content model of the element. For example, even if the display of the span element is changed to "block", it still would not allow to nest a div element inside it.</div>

    3. semantic/ non-semantic elements<br>
    -->A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. <br>
    Examples of non-semantic elements:<br>
     div and span <br>
     - Tells nothing about its content. <br>
     Examples of semantic elements:<br>
      form , table , and article <br>
     - Clearly defines its content.<br>
